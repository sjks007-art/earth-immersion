Location: A city in Korea

Milestone: Double digits! ðŸŽ¯
Today's 3-Line Practice

Empty cup allows new tea
Empty time creates Earth dialogue
Emptiness begins fullness

Reflection
Day 10 marks a significant milestone - double digits in our 365-day journey.
Today's theme emerged from washing my tumbler this morning. The emptiness isn't lack; it's potential. An empty refrigerator isn't a problem; it's a canvas for creativity.
This connects to the scarcity-growth principle from resilience research: limitations foster innovation.
Cumulative Impact (10 Days)
Single-use cups avoided: 30
Plastic bags refused: 20  
Mindful moments created: 10
Carbon footprint reduced: ~3.2kg
Technical Note
javascriptfunction embraceEmptiness() {
  let space = clear();
  let possibility = await new Promise();
  return growth;
}
The empty space in code (whitespace) makes it readable.
The empty space in life makes it livable.
Progress
Status: Day 10/365 âœ“
Consistency: 100%
Next milestone: Day 30

"In emptiness, we find infinite possibility."
