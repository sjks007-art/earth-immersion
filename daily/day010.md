## 📝 Reflection

Day 10 marks a significant milestone - double digits in our 365-day journey. Today's theme emerged from washing my tumbler this morning. The emptiness isn't lack; it's potential. An empty refrigerator isn't a problem; it's a canvas for creativity.

This connects to the scarcity-growth principle from resilience research: limitations foster innovation.

### 💚 Cumulative Impact (10 Days)
- Single-use cups avoided: 30
- Plastic bags refused: 20  
- Mindful moments created: 10
- Carbon footprint reduced: ~3.2kg

### 💻 Technical Note
```javascript
function embraceEmptiness() {
  let space = clear();
  let possibility = await new Promise();
  return growth;
}
```

The empty space in code (whitespace) makes it readable.  
The empty space in life makes it livable.
