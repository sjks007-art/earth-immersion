-----

## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Intention:** Today I have the courage to share sorrow  
**Question:** Why is listening to each other’s pain part of healing?  
**Gratitude:** Thank you for having a friend to share sorrow with

## 📞 A Phone Call

Today, a friend called me.

I noticed their profile picture looked different, so I reached out to check in. They told me they were going through an extremely difficult time.

And then… they cried.

Over the phone, I heard my friend’s tears breaking through the line. Without thinking, I started crying too.

-----

## 💬 What We Shared

For the first time since this journey began, I told someone other than my spouse about my own struggles.

I said: “I’ve been going through something difficult too.”

We cried together for over 30 minutes.

There weren’t many words of comfort. No advice. No solutions.

We just… existed together. Breathing together through the phone line. Sharing the weight of being human.

## 🧠 The Neuroscience of Empathy

Today I read 90 pages of *Inner Communication* (pages 240-330) - my biggest reading session yet.

The section was about the **mPFC-TPJ neural network**: the brain circuits responsible for interpersonal relationships and empathy.

**Key insight:** When these neural pathways recover, you regain the ability to:

- Sense others’ emotions
- Respond to others’ pain
- Connect beyond your own suffering

### Two Months Ago vs. Today

**Two months ago:**

- I couldn’t have taken that call
- Or if I did, I wouldn’t have felt anything
- My own pain consumed every available neuron
- No space to perceive anyone else’s suffering

**Today:**

- I felt my friend’s pain clearly
- I responded with genuine emotion
- I shared my own story
- I cried not just for myself, but *with* someone

This is recovery. Not the absence of pain, but the return of connection.

## 🍲 Gratitude for Simple Meals

**Lunch:** Korean potato stew (gamjatang) with my spouse  
**Dinner:** Eggs with my spouse and firstborn child

Simple food. But eating together, I kept thinking: *“I’m not alone.”*

-----

## ♻️ Environmental Actions

### What I Refused Today

- Disposable chopsticks from delivery order
- Disposable spoons from delivery order
- Paper cups (used my tumbler instead)

When the delivery arrived, I said: *“We have chopsticks and spoons at home. No need to include them.”*

Small choices. But they matter.

The planet is in pain too. And like my friend, it needs us to notice.

## 💡 Today’s Realization

**Healing isn’t a solo journey.**

When you listen to someone’s sorrow, your own sorrow starts to heal too.

When you feel someone’s tears, your own tears gain meaning.

Recovery isn’t about becoming strong enough to not need anyone.

**It’s about becoming well enough to be there for someone else again.**

## 🌍 Connection

**To my friend:** Thank you for trusting me with your pain. Thank you for listening to mine. Thank you for crying with me.

**To the planet:** I see you struggling too. I’m here. We’re here.

## 📚 Reading Notes: mPFC-TPJ Network

From *Inner Communication* (pp. 240-330):

**The mPFC-TPJ neural network consists of:**

- **mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex):** Self-referential thinking, understanding intentions
- **TPJ (temporoparietal junction):** Theory of mind, perspective-taking

**When this network is disrupted (trauma, depression, chronic stress):**

- Empathy decreases
- Social cognition impairs
- You can’t read others’ emotional states
- Connection feels impossible

**When this network recovers:**

- Empathy returns
- You can sense others’ feelings again
- Social connection becomes possible
- Shared experiences have meaning

**Today’s phone call was evidence that my mPFC-TPJ network is healing.**

## 💭 Reflection

Two months ago, I thought healing meant:

- Getting strong enough to handle everything alone
- Not burdening others with my pain
- Becoming independent and self-sufficient

Now I understand healing means:

- Being able to be present for someone else’s pain
- Trusting someone with your own struggle
- Realizing we’re all connected in our humanity

**Shared sorrow doesn’t double the pain. It halves it.**

-----

*Every day, 1 minute, 365 days*  
*Small actions save the planet 🌍*

**Thank you for being able to share sorrow again.**  
**Thank you for being human again.**
