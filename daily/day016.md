## 🌱 Today's 3-Line Practice

**Line 3 (Gratitude):** I'm grateful for family who remembers together

"Calming the amygdala, activating the prefrontal cortex"

I read this sentence again today. For the past two months, my amygdala has been screaming. Danger. Danger. Danger.

But today I discovered something unexpected: **sadness can quiet the amygdala too**.

-----

## 🏮 Chuseok Morning

Rain fell as we held ancestral rites at my childhood home. I thought of my father. My heart ached.

But the sadness felt... okay. Not wrong. Not something to fix.

Just there.

-----

## 👥 With My Sibling

We drove to my sibling's home together. We talked—really talked—for the first time in months.

"Are you okay?"  
"Yeah, I'm okay."

It wasn't a lie.

-----

## 🧬 What the Amygdala Does

The amygdala detects threats. It creates fear, anger, anxiety.

But grief is different. **Grief isn't a threat.**

Grief is just another name for love.

When I stopped pushing the sadness away, when I let it be, the amygdala went quiet.

-----

## 🧠 The Prefrontal Cortex Chooses

Page 166 explains: when the prefrontal cortex activates, we can choose our response.

Today I chose not to fight the sadness.

And in that choice, I found calm.

-----

## 📖 Respect and Storytelling

The book also talks about two things:
- **Respect your emotions**
- **Find meaning through stories**

The ancestral rites. My father's absence. My sibling's presence.

These pieces formed one story. Sadness, comfort, love—all coexisting, all real.

## 📊 16 Days Progress

- Disposable cups refused: 13
- Inner Communication reading: 166p / 1,784p
- Movement practice: Rested today
- Amygdala status: Calming
- Realization: Sadness is also stillness

## 🏥 Current Reality

The rain continues outside.

My amygdala is resting a little. My prefrontal cortex is slowly waking up.

Tomorrow will bring another day.

-----

## 💡 What I Learned

Not all environmental action is outward.

Sometimes the most important practice is inward: allowing emotions, sitting with discomfort, being present with what is.

**Even sadness can be a practice.**

The order still matters:
- Safety (creating calm)
- Recovery (allowing grief)
- Growth (understanding)
- Impact (later)

I'm still at step 1 and 2.

## 🌍 The Earth Immersion Project

**Day 16 of 365**

One minute a day, 365 days.  
Small actions save the Earth.

Today's action was internal:  
I let my nervous system rest.  
I respected my grief.  
I chose presence over performance.

The amygdala is learning it's safe.  
That's environmental action too.
