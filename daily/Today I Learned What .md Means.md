# Today I Learned What .md Means

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Location:** A city in Korea

-----

Every time I post on GitHub, I add `.md` to the file name.

```
day001.md
day002.md
day020.md
```

Every single time, I wondered:

- “Why .md?”
- “Is it just convention?”
- “Am I doing this just because everyone else does?”

## 💡 The Lightning Moment

Today, while talking with Claude, it hit me like lightning.

**`.md = Markdown`**

It’s the abbreviation for Markdown.

|Extension|Meaning     |
|---------|------------|
|`.html`  |HTML        |
|`.txt`   |Text        |
|`.pdf`   |PDF         |
|`.md`    |**Markdown**|

Such an obvious thing. Why didn’t I know?

## 😅 Confession Time

I didn’t know.

I created dozens of `.md` files without knowing it stood for Markdown.

I just followed what others did.

But today, I learned.

And I laughed at myself.

## 💭 On Learning

> There’s no shame in learning.

Admitting what you don’t know is the beginning of learning.

Today I learned about `.md`

What will I learn tomorrow?

## 🌱 To Those Who’ve Been Here

If you’ve ever used something for months without knowing what it really meant, you’re not alone.

**Every expert was once a beginner who wasn’t afraid to admit they didn’t know.**
