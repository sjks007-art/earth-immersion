## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Line 1 (Intention):** Today I practice receiving help  
**Line 2 (Exploration):** Why is receiving help also a capacity for love?  
**Line 3 (Gratitude):** Thank you to everyone who took care of me today

## 🧠 Inner Communication: Page 198

> “As the mPFC-TPJ neural network develops, interpersonal relationships improve.”

Today I read about the neuroscience of relationships.

**mPFC** = medial prefrontal cortex  
**TPJ** = temporoparietal junction

When these two brain regions connect well, we develop what the book calls “positive emotional sociality”—essentially, a warmer, more compassionate heart.

The research shows that people with well-developed mPFC-TPJ networks display higher levels of positive emotions in their relationships. They process information about themselves and others more effectively, strengthening their connection with the mPFC and related brain regions like the precuneus.

This leads to more intimate and caring relationships.

## 💚 A Day of Receiving

Today was practice in accepting help:

- My younger sibling took care of my two kids
- My spouse helped with housework
- I rested

At first, I felt guilty. “Why am I just resting while everyone helps me?”

But then I understood: **receiving help is also practicing love.**

-----

## 🔬 The Science of Gratitude

The book explains something profound:

When we receive kindness and respond with **gratitude** (not guilt), the mPFC-TPJ network activates. Our brain’s capacity for warm relationships actually grows stronger.

But when we respond with “I’m sorry for being a burden,” this network stays dormant.

**Two different responses, two different brain states:**

- “I’m sorry” → Guilt, shame, neural suppression
- “Thank you” → Gratitude, connection, neural growth

I’ve spent two months in the first state. Today, I practiced the second.

## 🌧️ Rainy Tuesday Reflections

Rain tapped on the window. My sibling sent photos of my kids laughing. My spouse asked what I wanted for dinner.

**Old response:**  
“I’m useless. I’m a burden. I’m sorry.”

**New practice:**  
“Thank you. I needed this rest. I love you.”

Small words. Big difference in neural pathways.

## 📊 17 Days Progress

- Disposable cups refused: 51 total
- Inner Communication reading: 198p / 1784p
- Times I accepted help today: 3
- Realization: Receiving is also a form of love

## 🏥 Current Reality

I’m still on medical leave. Recovery takes time.

But I’m learning that healing happens in relationships—not isolation. The mPFC-TPJ network doesn’t grow alone. It grows when we let others in.

Today’s environmental practice was minimal. But relationship practice was maximum.

And that’s okay. Recovery comes first.

-----

## 💡 What I Learned

The brain is designed for connection. When we receive kindness and respond with gratitude, our neural networks for love literally grow stronger.

It’s not weakness to accept help. It’s neuroscience.

The order matters:

1. Safety (medical leave)
1. Recovery (accepting help)
1. Relationships (mPFC-TPJ)
1. Growth (environmental practice)

I’m still at step 2. And that’s exactly where I need to be.

## 🌍 The Earth Immersion Project

**Day 17 of 365**

One minute a day, 365 days.  
Small actions save the Earth.

But first, we must save ourselves.  
Then we can save the planet.

Recovery → Relationships → Resilience → Revolution.
