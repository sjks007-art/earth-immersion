# Day 18: The Power of Noticing

**Date:** October 8, 2025 (Wednesday)  
**Location:** A city in Korea  
**Weather:** Unusually warm for autumn  
**Status:** On medical leave

## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Line 1 (Intention):** Today I notice the emotions of people around me  
**Line 2 (Exploration):** Why is sensing others’ feelings a sign of recovery?  
**Line 3 (Gratitude):** Thank you for being able to feel people again

## 🧠 Inner Communication: Pages 198-240

Today I read 42 pages in one sitting. The section on interpersonal relationships and emotional awareness.

The timing couldn’t have been more perfect.

-----

## 💡 The Morning Discovery

This morning, I looked at my spouse.

And I **noticed** something: they looked happy.

Not “maybe happy” or “probably happy.” Just clearly, unmistakably happy.

For the past two months, I couldn’t feel anything. My own emotions were chaotic. I had no space to notice how others felt.

But today was different.

## 🔬 The Neuroscience of Noticing

The book explains why this matters:

**When the amygdala is overactive (survival mode):**

- Hypervigilance for threats
- Reduced empathy
- Inability to read subtle emotional cues
- Interpersonal relationships deteriorate

**When the prefrontal cortex reactivates (recovery mode):**

- Emotional regulation returns
- Empathy resurfaces
- Ability to notice others’ emotions
- Social connections rebuild

Today, I experienced the second state for the first time in months.

## 🌍 Small Actions, Big Meanings

It was unusually warm today—climate change is visible in daily weather patterns.

I refused a disposable cup at the cafe. The barista recognized my tumbler: “You brought your own cup again!”

I smiled back.

That smile? That’s recovery too.

When you can care about disposable cups, when you can smile at strangers, when you notice someone else’s good mood—you’re healing.

## 📊 18 Days Progress

- Disposable cups refused: 54 ☕
- Inner Communication reading: 240p / 1784p (42 pages today!)
- Realization: **I can feel people again** 💡
- Evidence of recovery: Noticing spouse’s emotions, smiling at barista

-----

## 🏥 Current Reality

Recovery isn’t linear. But today showed me something important:

**The return of empathy is the return of humanity.**

For two months, I’ve been in survival mode. Today, I started living mode.

-----

## 💭 What I Learned

The order matters:

1. **Safety** - Remove yourself from harm ✅
1. **Recovery** - Calm the amygdala, reactivate prefrontal cortex (current stage)
1. **Growth** - Rebuild relationships and purpose
1. **Impact** - Contribute to the world again

I’m still at step 2. And that’s okay.

Today I took one small step forward: I felt someone else’s happiness.

## 🌍 The Earth Immersion Project

**Day 18 of 365**

One minute a day, 365 days.  
Small actions save the Earth.

To feel the Earth, first we must feel ourselves.  
To save the Earth, first we must heal ourselves.

The connection between personal recovery and environmental action is not metaphorical. It’s neurological.
