## 📝 Reflection

October 1st. A fresh calendar month unfolds before us. Today I realized: each new month is like version control in coding - we don't erase past commits, but we create a new branch for growth.

This morning's coffee tasted different. Not because the beans changed, but because October air carries a promise. The season is shifting, and with it, our relationship with Earth deepens.

### 💚 Cumulative Impact (11 Days)
- Single-use cups avoided: 33
- Plastic bags refused: 22  
- Mindful moments created: 11
- Carbon footprint reduced: ~3.5kg
- New month celebrations: 1

### 💻 Technical Note
```javascript
const october = {
  days: Array(31).fill(null),
  potential: Infinity,
  write: (day, action) => {
    october.days[day - 1] = action;
    return "Story in progress...";
  }
};
```

Every day is a parameter we can define.  
Every action is a function we can call.
