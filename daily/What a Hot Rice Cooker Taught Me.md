## 🍚 Context

This morning, I saw the pressure cooker my spouse didn’t clean up.

```
Initial Thought: "Why didn't they finish this?"
```

## 🔬 The Experiment

But today, I cooked rice myself.

The rice was done.  
Time to clean it up.

**…I couldn’t touch it.**

I could feel the heat without touching.

```
Result: "Oh, that's why."
```

## 💡 Eureka Moment

I remembered what I read from author Kim Jong-won:

> “Don’t judge without experiencing it yourself”

True.

I judged so easily without experiencing it.

One pressure cooker taught me a big lesson.

## 🎯 Key Insight

**Everyone has their own reasons.**

|My Perspective|Reality         |
|--------------|----------------|
|“Didn’t do it”|“Couldn’t do it”|

## ✅ Action Item

From today, I’ll ask first.  
Before judging.

```python
def before_judgment():
    question = "What if I were in their shoes?"
    return question
```
