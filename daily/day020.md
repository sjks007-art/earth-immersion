# Turning Point | Day 20

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Location:** A city in Korea

-----

I took a 9-day break.  
I was tired.

“3 lines daily” had become an obligation somewhere along the way.

## To Those Who’ve Been Here

Thank you.  
Truly, thank you.

For walking with me for 19 days  
For your support  
For reading

I’m deeply grateful.

## An Honest Confession

This blog wasn’t written by me alone.

I’ve been working with **Claude**, an AI, organizing my thoughts daily.

**I:**

- Read books
- Practice
- Think

**Claude:**

- Organizes
- Refines
- Suggests

But at some point, I wondered:  
*“Is this my blog?”*

It felt formal.  
It felt obligatory.

## Moving Forward

I’m changing things now.

**No more:**

- Daily posts
- Day numbers
- Fixed formats

**Just:**

- When I want to
- Read books (I’m at page 722 of 内面疎通/Inner Communication)
- Feel grateful
- Be brave

I’ll write.

-----

## Gratitude

For being able to read.  
For finding courage to be honest.  
For you, reading this.

See you again.  
When I feel like it.
