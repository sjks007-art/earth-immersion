## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Line 1 (Intention):** Today I connect my VIA strengths to my environmental practice  
**Line 2 (Exploration):** What if my strengths are my unique way to save Earth?  
**Line 3 (Gratitude):** Thank you for every moment that led me to discover myself

## 💭 The Discovery

For the past 13 days, I’ve been writing my 3 lines daily. But somewhere deep inside, I wondered: “Is this really my way?”

Yesterday evening through this morning, I completed the VIA Character Strengths assessment with Claude. 240 questions. One hour of facing myself.

It wasn’t about technology.  
It was a conversation with myself.

## 🌟 My Top 5 Strengths

The moment I saw the results, I almost cried.

1. **Gratitude** (40 points)
1. **Love of Learning** (39 points)
1. **Bravery** (39 points)
1. **Appreciation of Beauty** (39 points)
1. **Honesty** (33 points)

## 💡 The Revelation

**Gratitude as #1?**

I thought I was bad at gratitude. That’s why I tried so hard, writing gratitude every day as my 3rd line.

I thought it was a habit I had to build.  
But it turned out to be my **strength**.

I went back and read all 13 days.  
Every single day, the 3rd line was gratitude.

Without even realizing it.

## 🚶 This Afternoon’s Teacher

The overcast weather made it perfect for a walk.

On a quiet street, I saw an elderly woman.

Slowly, so slowly, she was picking up trash one by one. Plastic bags, paper cups, cigarette butts—collecting them carefully next to the trash can.

She didn’t have to do it.  
No one was watching.  
No one would praise her.

Just, silently.

-----

## 🎨 Beauty in Action

At that moment, I understood.

My #4 strength: Appreciation of Beauty.  
I’ve been taking sky photos often, without knowing why.  
Just because they were beautiful.

Today, that grandmother’s figure was the most beautiful thing I saw.

More beautiful than any sky I’ve photographed.

-----

## 🏡 The Small Practice

When I got home, I drank water.

From a glass cup, not a paper one.

A small practice, but today it felt special.

Like the grandmother.  
Even when no one’s watching.  
Silently.

## 🤔 Reflections on Strengths

**#3 Bravery, #5 Honesty**

I thought I lacked courage and was dishonest. So I tried to be brave, to be honest.

Could it be that my efforts transformed weakness into strength?

**#2 Love of Learning**

Reading environmental articles, checking data, always asking “Why?”—not just accepting “Plastic is bad!”

That was my way all along.

-----

## 🔄 A New Beginning

Starting tomorrow, I’ll write my 3 lines differently.

Centered on gratitude.

Discovering Earth’s gifts,  
Seeing their beauty,  
Learning,  
Being brave,  
Being honest.

That’s my way.
