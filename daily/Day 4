## Reflection

Day 4 of the Earth Immersion practice.

Wednesday marks the midpoint of the week.
A perfect time to pause and reflect on 
our small but meaningful actions.

This week's earth-friendly habits:
- Using reusable tumbler daily
- Taking stairs instead of elevator
- Refusing single-use items
- Teaching kids to appreciate nature

## Small Actions Count

The power of 1-minute daily practice:
- Day 1: Starting with excitement
- Day 2: Sharing with family
- Day 3: Building routine
- Day 4: Becoming a habit

Each morning now naturally begins with:
"What can I do for Earth today?"
