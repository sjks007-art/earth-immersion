# Day 15: The Empty Boat

**Date:** October 5, 2025 (Sunday)  
**Location:** A city in Korea  
**Weather:** Mostly cloudy  
**Status:** On medical leave

-----

## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Line 1 (Intention):** Today I observe what stands between events and emotions  
**Line 2 (Exploration):** Was I angry at the empty boat, or at my interpretation?  
**Line 3 (Gratitude):** Thank you for the power to notice

-----

## 🧠 Inner Communication: Page 104

Two phrases stopped me today:

**Amygdala stabilization.**  
**Prefrontal cortex activation.**

These two terms explained my entire day.

## 🛶 The Empty Boat Story

There’s an example in the book I’m reading:

> A: Resting peacefully in a shelter  
> B: Collision with empty boat → anger  
> C: Embarrassment

At first, I just read past it. But it stayed with me.

Why get angry at an empty boat?

An empty boat means nobody’s inside. Nobody deliberately disturbed you. It just drifted with the current.

Yet anger arose. Why?

**“Someone is invading my peaceful moment.”**

That belief was there.

**A (boat collision) → B (interpreted as invasion) → C (anger)**

Between the event and the emotion, my belief created the response.

-----

## 💭 The Exhausted Person

That person in the story was probably exhausted by people. Seeking rest without disturbance.

So even an empty boat felt like intrusion.

I understand. I’m the same.

-----

## 🧘 When Practice Doesn’t Work

I’ve tried meditation. I’ve exercised. Heart rate zone training.

Honestly? I can’t feel much effect.

This isn’t my first time reading Inner Communication. Yet my amygdala still sounds alarms.

Danger. Danger. Danger.

-----

## 🎯 The Real Problem

Then I realized:

**The problem isn’t me. It’s the environment.**

No matter how much you meditate, if empty boats keep colliding in your shelter, you need to leave that shelter.

-----

## 💎 VIA Strengths and Survival Mode

Yesterday’s VIA assessment showed:

- Gratitude (1st)
- Love of Learning (2nd)
- Bravery (3rd)
- Appreciation of Beauty (4th)
- Honesty (5th)

I wanted these strengths to “grow like an avalanche.”

But today I learned: **strengths don’t grow in survival mode.**

There’s an order:

1. Find safe shelter
1. Recover
1. Then grow strengths

I was trying to skip step 2.

## 📊 15 Days Progress

- Disposable cups refused: 13
- Inner Communication reading: 104p / 1784p
- Empty boat collisions noticed: 1
- Realization: Environment first

-----

## 🏥 Current Reality

I’m on medical leave. Away from the collision point.

No environmental practice today. I focused on surviving.

That’s enough.

-----

## 💡 What I Learned

You can’t save Earth if you can’t save yourself first.

The order matters:

- Safety
- Recovery
- Growth
- Impact

I’m still at step 1.

-----

## 🌍 The Earth Immersion Project

**Day 15 of 365**

One minute a day, 365 days.  
Small actions save the Earth.

But first, I must save myself.
