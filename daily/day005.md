Thursday is for gratitude.
Taking a moment to appreciate

## 5 Things to Thank Earth For

1. **Air to Breathe**
   - Every breath, every moment
   - Oxygen created by trees
   - Free, yet priceless

   - 7 billion years of circulation
   - The essence of life

3. **Warmth from the Sun**
   - Morning sunlight through windows
   - Energy traveled 150 million km
   - 8 minutes old, yet fresh

4. **Ground to Stand On**
   - Solid earth beneath our feet
   - 4.6 billion years of support
   - Our home, Mother Earth

5. **Life All Around**
   - Trees, birds, microorganisms
   - Never alone
   - Connected ecosystem

## The Power of Gratitude

From Day 1 to Day 5,
practicing gratitude changes perspective:

**When grateful, we see:**
- Plastic we use mindlessly
- Food we waste carelessly
- Energy we consume thoughtlessly

**When grateful, we change:**
- Tumbler becomes habit
- Food waste reduces
- Lights turn off automatically
