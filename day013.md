## 🌱 Today’s 3-Line Practice

**Line 1 (Intention):** Today I practice benefiting all humanity through Earth care  
**Line 2 (Exploration):** Why does Gojoseon’s ancient spirit connect with today’s environmental action?  
**Line 3 (Gratitude):** Thank you for this land our ancestors preserved for us

## 🇰🇷 Gaecheonjeol: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Relevance

Today is **Gaecheonjeol** (開天節), Korea’s National Foundation Day, commemorating the founding of Gojoseon—Korea’s first kingdom—in 2333 BCE by Dangun Wanggeom.

### The Founding Principle: Hongik Ingan

The kingdom was founded on a principle called **“Hongik Ingan” (弘益人間)**—broadly benefit all humanity.

4,700 years ago, this meant creating a just society, promoting culture, and caring for all people. But what does “benefit all humanity” mean in 2025?

**The answer became clear:**

- Clean air to breathe
- Safe water to drink
- Land we can live on

**To truly benefit humanity, we must first benefit the Earth.**

This ancient philosophy suddenly felt incredibly relevant to our environmental crisis.

## 💚 Practicing Ancient Wisdom Through Daily Actions

Even on a national holiday, I maintained my environmental practices:

### Morning: The Cafe

- Brought my reusable tumbler
- Barista’s question: “Even on a national holiday?”
- My answer: “Especially on a national holiday. When we have time to do things right.”

### Afternoon: The Grocery Store

- Carried reusable bag despite crowds
- Long checkout line—everyone shopping on the holiday
- While waiting, I realized: this one bag reduces plastic → prevents ocean pollution → preserves clean seas for the next generation

**That’s what “benefit all humanity” means.**

Not just people alive today. Everyone who comes after us.

## 🌍 Connecting Ancient Philosophy to Climate Action

### Why Gaecheonjeol Matters for Environmental Movement

The founders of Gojoseon couldn’t have imagined:

- Climate change
- Plastic pollution
- Species extinction
- Ecosystem collapse

But they understood something **timeless:**

> We’re all connected.  
> What helps one, helps all.  
> What harms the Earth, harms humanity.

### From 2333 BCE to 2025 CE

The bridge between ancient wisdom and modern action isn’t just philosophical—it’s practical.

**Hongik Ingan today means:**

1. **Environmental stewardship** - caring for the planet that sustains all life
1. **Intergenerational justice** - preserving resources for future generations
1. **Collective responsibility** - recognizing our interconnected fate
1. **Daily practice** - translating values into concrete actions

Every reusable cup, every declined plastic bag, every mindful choice is an act of benefiting all humanity.

-----

## 💭 Reflection: Cultural Wisdom in Global Crisis

Different cultures have different expressions of the same truth:

- Korean: **Hongik Ingan** (弘益人間) - broadly benefit humanity
- Ubuntu philosophy: “I am because we are”
- Indigenous wisdom: “Seven generations principle”
- Buddhist concept: Interdependence of all beings

**Common thread:** We are all connected. Our actions ripple through time and space.

**Modern application:** Climate action isn’t just environmental policy—it’s living out these ancient truths.
