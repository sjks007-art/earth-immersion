## 🌱 About This Project

Save Earth with 1 minute, 3 lines of practice daily.

### Core Practice
- **Breath** - Breathe with Earth
- **Mind** - Think for Earth
- **Gratitude** - Thank Earth

> "A small seed creates a forest,  
> A butterfly's wings create a storm,  
> 1 minute of immersion saves Earth."

## 🎯 Why 3-Line Immersion?

### Scientific Foundation
- 🧠 **1 Minute = Minimum Effective Time** - Neuroscience-proven focus unit
- 🌊 **3 Steps = Perfect Rhythm** - Based on Prof. Hwang's immersion theory
- 💚 **Daily = Habit Formation** - 21-day rule for lasting change

### Impact on Earth
```
1 person × 1 minute = 1 less disposable item
100 people × 1 minute = 100kg CO₂ reduction
10,000 people × 1 minute = 1 forest effect
1,000,000 people × 1 minute = 0.001°C global cooling
```
